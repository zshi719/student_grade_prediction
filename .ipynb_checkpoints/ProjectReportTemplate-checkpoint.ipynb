    "abstract: _Using data from two Portuguese secondary schools, this project examines the connection between individual factors and educational outcomes. Focusing on inference rather than prediction, this study creates three classification models to investigate the explanatory correlation between student demographics, social and school-related characteristics, and the final year grade, G3. The findings indicate that past evaluations have a significant impact on student achievement, and that education attendance plays a significant role in determining educational success regardless of socioeconomic and demographic factors. In addition, the study suggests that policymakers and educators prioritize improving attendance rates and provide targeted support for students who are struggling. Parents can also play an important role in their children's education. The study concludes that additional research is required to identify additional strategies for enhancing academic achievement_.\n",

In future work, it will be important to take these considerations into account and apply appropriate data cleaning and preparation techniques to ensure the validity of the results.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Identification of categorical variables: All columns in the data frame were reviewed to identify the categorical variables. A loop comprehension was used to find the number of unique values corresponding to each column, and this information was used to decide on the data processing approach.\n",
    "- Conversion of yes-no variables to binary variables: The code created a dictionary for binary mapping and applied it to all columns in the data frame that contained 'yes' or 'no' as the response.\n",
    "- Transformation of predictors with 2 unique values: The code transformed predictors with two unique values into binary variables by mapping them to 0 or 1. This was done for variables such as \"school\", \"sex\", \"famsize\", \"address\", and \"Pstatus\".\n",
    "- Creation of new predictors: To handle variables with more than two unique values, the code created dummy variables using the \"get_dummies\" function in pandas. The dummy variables were created for the \"Mjob\", \"Fjob\", \"reason\", and \"guardian\" columns. The original columns were then dropped, and the dummy variables were concatenated with the original data frame.\n",
    "- Combination of correlated predictors: The code combined the \"Dalc\" and \"Walc\" columns into a single \"Alc\" column to reduce correlation between the two variables, and combined the \"Fedu\" and \"Medu\" columns into a single \"famEdu\" column to capture the combined education of both parents. This helped to reduce data redundancy and the noise in the data set, and removed the multicollinearity.\n",
    "- Conversion of data types: The original data frame, which consisted of both categorical and numerical values, was converted into one that only consisted of numerical data types or uint8. This made it easier and more convenient for later variable selection and model development.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the data cleaning and preparation phase transformed and prepared the data for analysis by converting categorical variables into binary or numerical values, combining correlated predictors, and converting the data types into a more convenient format for analysis. These steps helped to ensure the validity of the results and facilitated later variable selection and model development."

This can be problematic because binary variables typically have a non-linear relationship with the outcome variable, and it can be difficult to predict a continuous score with such data. Moreover, using all categorical close-to-binary data for a prediction problem from a scale of 0-20 is a bad idea because it can result in inaccurate predictions and may not capture the nuances of the data.

In K-Fold cross-validation, the data was divided into K equal parts, and the model was trained and tested K times, with each part being used as the test set once. In the train-test split, the data was divided into a training set and a validation set, and the model was trained on the training set and tested on the validation set.\n",

    "Two different feature selection methods were employed to identify the most important quantitative and categorical predictors.\n",

Then, the SelectKBest method was applied to choose the top 5 features based on their chi-square scores. The scores were stored in a pandas Series object and sorted in descending order to display the most significant categorical predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision tree search:  To select the most important quantitative predictors, a Decision Tree Regressor model was fitted to the training data. We used `DecisionTreeRegressor` as opposed to `DecisionTreeClassifier` as we were treating the problem as a prediction problem on the first hand, followed by manual classification based on the pass/fail threshold.  Feature importances were calculated, and used a horizontal bar plot was created to visualize the top 10 features with the largest importance values. Variables `failures` and `absences` were identified as the two most important features.\n",

    "Given the limitations of a non-linear regressor (`DecisionTreeRegressor`) in identifying important features for linear regression, more than one decision tree was built to analyze and identify the important features. While the selected features often vary,  the most important factors kept at each tree's top branch - features consistently selected as the most important ones regardless of trees built - were `failures` and `absences`. With this information, the base model was developed using only these 2 most important features, along with their interaction terms.\n",

The extremely small P-value means that the interaction is statistically significant.The other models, although achieving an accuracy of 1.0 on the test set and the full dataset, do not account for the interaction between absences and failures. This could lead to a less accurate prediction of student grades in real-world scenarios where the the effect of absences on student grades is not constant across students who have experienced different levels of failures. By including the interaction term, the last model better accounts for the combined influence of absences and failures on student grades, making it the best choice among the four models presented.\n",

In other words, predicting a student as able to improve when they cannot (False positives) will be harmful because the teacher will put effort in this student. Thus, the most important metric in the classification of improvement is FP. The model based on Lasso has lower FPR and other measurements are reasonable, so we will use progress_model_1_1 to predict whether a student improves from the first test to the second test. \n",

Since both models have an obvious disadvantage, we will select the final model based on what we concern more--FPR, so we will use progress_model_2_2 to predict whether a student improves from the second test to the final test. \n"

    "1. Absences and failures are important quantitative predictors in determining a student's grades. As such, it is essential to consider these factors when developing early warning systems aimed at ensuring the academic success of students who may be susceptible to these challenges. By closely monitoring students' attendance and performance, educators can intervene proactively and provide tailored support to help students overcome the obstacles that absences and failures may present. Implementing such a system will not only help to identify students at risk but also enable timely interventions that can significantly enhance their chances of academic success and overall well-being.\n",
    "2. School support and parents' jobs have emerged as important quantitative predictors of students' grades in our analysis. These factors significantly influence a student's academic performance, highlighting the need to consider them when designing early warning systems. By identifying students who may be susceptible to the challenges associated with limited school support or specific parental occupations, targeted interventions can be developed to ensure their academic success. Incorporating these predictors into an early warning system allows schools and educators to proactively address potential issues, providing tailored support and resources to help students overcome these odds and achieve their full potential.\n",

    "5. Mother's job plays a important part for both the improvement from G1 to G2 and G2 to G3. This variable Mjob consists the categories 'teacher', 'health' care related, civil 'services' (e.g. administrative or police), 'at_home' or 'other', and being a teacher and other jobs have positive relationship with the increase in grade for students. I believe probably health care and civil service jobs require a lot of time and effort, and mothers do not have enough time to accompany their kids and help with their learning. Also, housewives might not have enough knowledge to help their kids study.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Also, the reason why a students chooses this school is related to their progress. The variable consists of values: close to 'home', school 'reputation', 'course' preference or 'other'. From the two models, reason_other has positive coefficient in the model for G1_G2 and reason_course has negative coefficient in the model for G2_G3. I think one major category that contains in 'other' might be achieving personal growth and learn knowledge, and this could stimulate student's interest in studying, and thus improvement in scores. In contrast, if the student only thinks the courses are interesting, they will not care much about their grades, so the coefficient in front of reason_course will be negative. "
